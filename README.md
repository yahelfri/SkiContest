*********************************** About this project ***********************************
The "Ski contest" project is wrriten in Java using the Swing class.
The main purpose of it is to get to know and implement design patterns.
The DP I implemented here are:
                                Decorator
                                Deligator
                                Builder
                                Factory method
                                Prototype
                                Singleton
                                ThreadPool
                                and so..
                                

This project is an actually ski contest simulator.
the user can set the contest properties (number of contesters, arena details and so..).
Eventually, the user starts the competition and on the screen there will be skiers images simulating the contest on a mountain slope image.

The project files are gathered in a zip file in this repository.

Hope you'll enjoy it :)
